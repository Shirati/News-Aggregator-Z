# News-Aggregator-Z
The project aims to develop a microservice-based application that aggregates news and technology updates based on user preferences.
The system will fetch the latest news, pick up most interesting news using AI based on user preferences (optionally generate concise summaries using AI), 
and send this information to users via email, Telegram, or other communication channels.
